    <!-- Steps for making lasagna -->
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the lasagna pasta sheets in boiling, salted water until they are al dente. Drain and set them aside.
        </li>
        <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground meat (beef, pork, or a combination) with finely chopped onion and minced
            garlic until the meat is browned and the onions are translucent.</li>
        <li>Add tomato sauce to the meat mixture and season it with herbs and spices like basil, oregano, salt, and
            pepper.
            Simmer for a few minutes to create a flavorful meat sauce.
        </li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix together ricotta cheese, shredded mozzarella cheese, and grated Parmesan cheese.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to the recommended temperature (usually around 350°F or 180°C).</li>
        <li>In a baking dish, start assembling the lasagna layers. Begin with a thin layer of the meat sauce, followed
            by a
            layer of lasagna pasta sheets, and then a layer of the cheese mixture. Repeat these layers until the dish is
            filled,
            finishing with a top layer of cheese.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes. Then,
            remove the
            foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna rest for a few minutes before serving to allow it to set. Then, slice and enjoy your
            homemade
            lasagna!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>These steps outline the basic process for making a classic meat lasagna. Feel free to customize with additional
        ingredients like vegetables or a bechamel sauce for variations.
